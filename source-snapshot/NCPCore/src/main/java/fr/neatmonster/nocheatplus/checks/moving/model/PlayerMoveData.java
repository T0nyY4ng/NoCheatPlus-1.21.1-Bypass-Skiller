     * <pre>
     * Assume a hypothetical riptide velocity of {@code x1 y2 z1}:
     * if the trident is released at the end of the movement while the player is on
     * ground, the vertical move of 1.2 is processed first and the riptide push is applied
     * afterwards. In this case, two separate packets are sent: {@code x0 y1.2 z0} and then {@code x1 y2 z1};
     * the movement is, in a way, "split" into two distinct updates.
     *
     * If the trident is instead released at the start of the movement while the player is
     * on ground, the code executes normally within a single movement update,
     * resulting in a single packet of {@code x1 y3.2 z1}.
     * </pre>
     * The {@code MAYBE} flag represents the on ground state during riptide,
